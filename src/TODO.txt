[ ] Bounding-box clearing. In Renderer update, when calculating screen coordinates
    then also keep track of min and max x,y (bbox).
    Probably easiest to keep global bbox instead of
    making bunch of local clears as that sounds like even slower.

[x] Use : isAnyKeyDown to reduce the key polling time..

[x] Light minimum value (full black looks bad)

[ ] Object center distance to camera, per object render order.
    Before rendering sort modelsArray by distancd.
    -> could also check object circular size that could be calculated during ctor

[x] Allow texture path as "".On ctor check if texture path is not "" and there is uv coordinates
    -> if any is false set bool has texture = false

[ ] Render mode: Make it per model. Store render mode value in Model class.

[ ] Make render modes cleaner instead of copy paste 6x times...

[ ] Look into DMA. Example in CPBoy src/cas/bootstrap.cpp
